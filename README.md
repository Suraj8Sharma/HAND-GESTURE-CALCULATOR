# HAND-GESTURE-CALCULATORHand Gesture Arithmetic

This project is a simple AI-based hand gesture calculator that uses OpenCV and MediaPipe to recognize hand gestures and perform basic arithmetic operations. You can select operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and operands using finger gestures.

📌 Features

Detects hand gestures in real-time using a webcam.

Recognizes fingers to select operations and operands.

Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Displays results on the screen.

🛠 Technologies Used

Python

OpenCV (for image processing)

MediaPipe (for hand tracking)

NumPy (for efficient calculations)

🔧 Installation

1️⃣ Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Hand-Gesture-Calculator.git
cd Hand-Gesture-Calculator

2️⃣ Install Dependencies

pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy

3️⃣ Run the Program

python gesture_calculator.py

📌 How It Works

Show fingers to select an operation:

1 Finger → Addition (+)

2 Fingers → Subtraction (-)

3 Fingers → Multiplication (×)

4 Fingers → Division (÷)

Show fingers again to select the first operand.

Show fingers again to select the second operand.

The result is displayed on the screen.

The program resets after a few seconds to allow new calculations.

📷 Example Output

🏆 Future Improvements

Improve gesture recognition accuracy.

Add support for multi-digit numbers.

Implement advanced mathematical operations.

Create a GUI for better interaction.
